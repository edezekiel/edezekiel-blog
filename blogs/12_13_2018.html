          <p> <strong>TLDR:</strong> the brower parses an html file, creates the DOM, and stores
            the DOM in memory.</p>

          <p>My blog post this week deals with the Document Object Model (DOM).
            If you are not familiar with this concept, mozilla has a great explainer
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">here</a>.
          </p>

          <p>At Flatiron, we've discussed what the DOM is, why it's important, and how to access
           it. However, we haven't address where the DOM is stored.
           For some reason I found this topic especially interesting this week.
           This blog post
           is about my journey searching for and reaching the answer to that question.</p>

          <p><strong>Down the Rabbit Hole - <code>window</code> and <code>document</code> </strong></p>

          <p>My journey started with an exercise from a JavaScript instructional video on Youtube.</p>
          <p> I recently watched the "JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts"
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts">video</a> by Tony Alicia.
          If you skip to 29:00, he creates and opens an empy "app.js" file
          in the browser. The app.js file strangely has zero code written in it.</p>

          <p>After opening the browser, Tony launches chrome's dev console and
            enters the word <code>window</code>. A window property with hundreds
            of key/value pairs seemingly appears out of nowhere. Entering
            <code>document</code> in the console for a blank site similarly yields
            some kind of pre-defined property.
          </p>

          <p>According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">MDN</a>,
            "the <code>window</code> interface represents a window containing a
            DOM document; the <code>document</code> property points to the DOM
            document <strong>loaded</strong> in that window."</p>

          <p><strong>Loaded From Where?</strong></p>

          <p></p>
          <p>As MDN explains above, the browser "loads" the <code>document</code>
            into the window. But where is the DOM loaded from?</p>

          <p>After some googling I landed on this answer from <a href="https://reactkungfu.com/2015/10/the-difference-between-virtual-dom-and-dom/">React Kung Fu</a>:
            <blockquote cite="https://reactkungfu.com/2015/10/the-difference-between-virtual-dom-and-dom/">
              "So, while HTML is a text, the DOM is an <strong>in-memory representation</strong>
              of this text."
            </blockquote>
          </p>

          <p>In other words, the browser stores the DOM in RAM. My next question
            was how?</p>

          <p><strong>The Rendering Engine - How HTML Gets Transformed Into the DOM</strong></p>

          <p><a href="https://link.medium.com/V8nfg6ioBS">Here's</a> an excerpt from
            a post on medium that answers how the DOM gets loaded into memory:
            <blockquote cite="https://link.medium.com/V8nfg6ioBS">
              The browser's rendering engine receives the contents of the requested
              document from the networking layer. The first step of the rendering
              engine is parsing the HTML document and converting the parsed
              elements to actual DOM nodes in a DOM tree.
            </blockquote>
            </p>

          <p>This process can be broken down further into "conversion,"
           "tokenizing", "lexing", and DOM "construction." See <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/constructing-the-object-model">this</a>
           article by Google Web for more info.</p>

        <p><strong>One Last Experiment With JavaScript Runtime Environments</strong></p>

          <p>Google Chrome's Javascript Engine is called <a href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a>.
          V8 is also used a JavaScript runtime environment called
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>.</p>

          <p>Unlike Chrome, Node.js does not run in the browser. It didn't make
          sense to me to have a DOM without a browser, but I wanted to confirm.
          I started Node.js by entering <code>node</code> in my terminal, and
          then I entered <code>document</code>. As I expected, the terminal returned
          <code>ReferenceError: document is not defined</code>.
