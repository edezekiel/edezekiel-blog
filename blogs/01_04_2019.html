          <p>January 4, 2019</p>

          <p>January marks the beginning of 2019 and the end of mod 3. This mod has been
            the most challenging yet. As I discussed in my last blog post, it
            took me a while to wrap my head around several mod 3 concepts.</p>

          <p>After weeks of debugging, practicing, and coding, I have finally
            completed my mod 3 project! Here are links to the <a href="https://github.com/edezekiel/frontend-coffee-bulma">frontend</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/edezekiel/backend-coffee-bulma">backend</a>.</p>

          <p>This post is about my key takeaways from the past few weeks.</p>

          <strong><p>Know When To Take A Step Back</p></strong>

          <p>Going to a coding bootcamp can feel like a cramming session.
          Labs stack up, project deadlines get closer, and study sessions run late.
          Even so, it is incredibly important to take breaks.</p>

          <p>This project really tested my mental endurance, which is why
          taking breaks was critical. It helped that Christmas and New Year's
          fell in the middle of the mod. They helped/forced me to take a step
          back from the code. After a few days of rest the concepts started
          coming together.</p>

          <strong><p>Thoughts on External APIs (Use Faker Instead)</p></strong>

          <p>At the beginning of my project I considered using an external API
          like yelp fusion. Their API is really easy to use and the documentation
          is great.</p>

          <p>Notably, you can make yelp API requests without having to
          set up advanced OAuth2 tokens. OAuth2 tokens are important, but beyond
          the scope of my project.</p>

          <p>I got as far as seeding my rails database with data from yelp API.
          Eventually, though, I used the Ruby gem "Faker" to create my seed data.</p>

          <strong><p>Faker</p></strong>

          <p>Faker is amazing. It lets you build seed data amazingly fast with
          just a few lines of code. You don't have to learn API-specific rules,
          set up OAuth tokens, or manually create object instances.</p>

          <p>Here is the entirety of my db.seed file for my mod 3 project:</p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/edezekiel/c6e848bf0371855c0e850ad79064ff11.js"></script>

          <p>With this seed file, I had enough data to test my rails associations
          and render my website.</p>

          <strong><p>Bulma</p></strong>

          <p>I decided to switch up my CSS framework for this project. Bulma is
            modern and based around the CSS
          Flexbox feature. My feelings about Bulma are mixed.</p>

          <p>Pros:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>It is incredibly easy to get set up. Just paste <a href="https://gist.github.com/edezekiel/41e3fc3e0bf229043d192d4260d94898">this</a> header.</li>
              <li>The standard configurations make it easy to set up a hero
              banner, navBar, footer, etc.</li>
              <li>The features look good.</li>
            </ol>
          <p>Cons</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The documentation is a little bit sparse;</li>
              <li>It was surprisingly difficult to implement a basic flex wrap
              system for "cards" or "tiles." At a few points I was tempted
              to ditch the framework and just code the CSS using Flexbox.</li>
              <li>Setting up event handlers on "form" buttons was a nightmare.
              I didn't have problem getting the event listeners to work before
              adding Bulma, but afterwards it took hours of debugging.</li>
            </ol>
