          <p>October 17, 2018</p>
          <p>Flatiron's software engineering immersive program in Atlanta starts in just a few days and I could not be more excited. So excited that I'm doing a mid-week update to the site! The main changes include removing Flexbox (for now), adding a functional navigation bar, adding a "hero banner," and incorporating google analytics.</p>

          <p><dt>Flexbox</dt><dd>I had a lot of fun working with Flexbox while writing my last post. However, I removed the Flexbox display to see how much I could do with just HTML and CSS's normal flow. As it turns out, everything you see here can be developed without Flexbox.</dd></p>
          <p><dt>Navigation Bar</dt><dd>Creating the navigation bar took a bit of trial and error. I eventually landed on sleek <a href="https://wearefieldtrip.com/journal/css-horizontal-navigation-bar/">navbar tutorial</a> from Fieldtrip. The instructions were clear and concise.</dd></p>

          <p><dt>The Banner</dt><dd>A hero banner, like the image above, is a very large banner image used in website design to help engage users. Sites like <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/">Webdesignerdepot</a> and <a href="https://www.artonicweb.com/learn/hero-images/">artonic</a> have great examples. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb_EwQOa_ao">tutorial</a> on youtube was a good guide.</dd></p>

          <p><dt>Google Analytics</dt><dd>If you right click and "View Page Source," you might notice a "google-site-verification" item in the <code>head</code>. I set up the verification and google analytics for this site after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El3IZFGERbM">video by Maile Ohye</a> from google webmasters.</dd></p>

          <p>I hope you enjoyed reading this post. I'll be back soon with more updates about my software engineering journey.</p>
