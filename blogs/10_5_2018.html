          <p>October 5, 2018</p>
            <p>Welcome to the inaugural post! For my first project, I will walk through how I set up this blog. There are four basic steps: (1) choose your web hosting service, (2) pick a domain name, (3) create an html file, and (4) upload the file.</p>
            <dl>
              <p><dt>1. Choose a Web Hosting Service</dt>
              <dd><a href="https://hostingfacts.com/">Hostingfacts.com</a> recently published its list of the "10 Best Web Hosting Services in 2018." They listed Bluehost as #1 for best reliability. After doing a bit more research I decided to go with Bluehost. </dd></p>
              <p><dt>2. Pick a Domain Name</dt>
              <dd>My next step was picking a domain name (edezekiel.com).</dd></p>
              <p><dt>3. Create the HTML File</dt>
              <dd>I used Sublime to create this html file. I named the file "index.html."</dd></p>
              <p><dt>4. Upload the HTML File</dt>
              <dd>This step was my biggest hurdle, but I found a great tutorial on youtube at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUmfXTnFMuw"><span>dancourses</span></a>. Dan explains the cpanel and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) methods for uploading a HTML file. Cpanel is a linux webhost used by Bluehost and other web hosting services. You can log into cpanel by adding "/cpanel" to the end of your website name (e.g., "www.edezekiel.com/cpanel"). FTP creates a connection between a computer and a hosting account. Cpanel got the job done for now, but I will use FTP as my website grows.</dd></p>

            <p>Thank you for reading. I have a lot of exciting posts for this blog coming soon, and I can't wait to see where this project takes me.</p>
