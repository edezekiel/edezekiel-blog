          <p><h1>About Me</h1></p>
          <p>My name is Ed Ezekiel. I am a student at <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">
            Flatiron's</a> immersive software engineering bootcamp in Atlanta.
            This blog is about programming, web development, and my journey
            from practicing law to loving code.</p>

            <p>I grew up in Rockville, Maryland and my wife is from Memphis, TN.
              When I'm not programming, I'm probably cheering on Atlanta United
            with my wife Farley, or playing with my dogs Buddy and Grace.</p>

          <h1>❤️ Code</h1>

          <p>My passion for coding began when I was working at UnitedLex. I
            managed document review projects involving millions of files, so I
            had to quickly pick up computer skills like:
              <ul>
                <li>performing advanced database queries;</li>
                <li>writing excel programs; and</li>
                <li>creating virtual workspaces.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>

          <p>I discovered macros, Visual Basic, and keyboard shortcuts that
            seemed like magic. Excel programming and querying was fun, but I
            became curious about the broader field of programming.
            Over the next two years I took more online lessons, learned bits
            about computer science, and started looking into bootcamps.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year I ran into Flatiron's free online <a href="https://flatironschool.com/free-courses/coding-bootcamp-prep/">
          Coding Bootcamp Prep Course</a>. Since then I have been completely
          hooked on programming. I decided to follow my passion and now I am a
          student at Flatiron!</p>
