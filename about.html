          <p>My name is Ed Ezekiel. I am a student at the Flatiron School's
            immersive software engineering bootcamp in Atlanta.</p>

          <p>This blog is about how to build website from scratch, and what its like
            to attend a software engineering bootcamp.</p>

          <p>My passion for coding began when I was at the legal tech company.
            I learned a bit of SQL and Excel VBA, and then took some programming courses.
            Since then I haven't been able to shake the coding bug!</p>

            <p>When I'm not at a computer, I'm probably cheering on Atlanta United
            with my wife, Farley Ezekiel, or playing with my dogs Buddy and Grace.</p>

          <p>I grew in Maryland just outside of Washington D.C.
            In 2012, my wife and I moved to Atlanta to attend Emory law school.</p>

          <p>Since I moved to Atlanta, Iâ€™ve graduated from law school,
            worked at a legal tech company, and practiced environmental
            law at Smith, Gambrell, & Russell, LLP.</p>
