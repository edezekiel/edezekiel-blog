	<h2>Websites From Scratch.</h2>

    <p>Learn web development with me as I build a blog from scratch.</p>

	<h2>How Do I Start a Blog?</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the inaugural post! For my first project, I will walk through how I set up this blog. There are four basic steps: (1) choose your web hosting service, (2) pick a domain name, (3) create an html file, and (4) upload the file.</p>

	<p>1) Web Hosting Service: <a href="https://hostingfacts.com/"><span>hostingfacts.com</span></a> recently published its list of the "10 Best Web Hosting Services in 2018." They listed Bluehost as #1 for best reliability. After doing a bit more research I decided to go with Bluehost. </p>

	<p>2) Domain Name: My next step was picking a domain name (edezekiel.com).</p>

	<p>3) Create an HTML File: I used Sublime to create this html file. I named the file "index.html."</p>

	<p>4) Upload the HTML File: This step was my biggest hurdle, but I found a great tutorial on youtube at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUmfXTnFMuw"><span>dancourses</span></a>. Dan explains the cpanel and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) methods for uploading a HTML file. Cpanel is a linux webhost used by Bluehost and other web hosting services. You can log into cpanel by adding "/cpanel" to the end of your website name (e.g., "www.edezekiel.com/cpanel"). FTP creates a connection between a computer and a hosting account. Cpanel got the job done for now, but I will use FTP as my website grows.</p>

	<p>Thank you for reading! I have a lot of exciting posts for this blog coming soon, and I can't wait to see where this project takes me.</p>
