						<h3>CSS Styling & Flexbox</h3>
							<p>October 12, 2018</p>
							<p>This week I added some style to my blog using CSS and Flexbox. This post summarizes these concepts and describes how I applied them to my site.</p>
							<p>CSS stands for Cascading-Style-Sheets. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users -- how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
							<p>The Flexible Box Module (Flexbox) is a new layout mode that was introduced CSS3. See this article by spaceninja, <a href="https://spaceninja.com/2015/08/24/what-is-flexbox/"><span>"What is Flexbox, An elegant layout method for a more civilized age",</span></a> for a great background on the origin and purpose of Flexbox.</p>
							<p>When a browser displays a document, it actually displays a combination of the document's content with its style information. Web browsers convert the document's content (the HTML) and style information (CSS) into the Document Object Model (DOM). When you view a webpage you are actually viewing a display of the contents of the DOM.</p>
							<p>I created the CSS style sheet and linked it to my HMTL file. Then I used a great guide from <a href='https://markheath.net/post/simple-css-blog-layout-flexbox'><span>markheath.net</span></a> to incorporate Flexbox concepts into the CSS and HTML files.</p>
						<h3>How Do I Start a Blog?</h3>
							<p>October 5, 2018</p>
							<p>Welcome to the inaugural post! For my first project, I will walk through how I set up this blog. There are four basic steps: (1) choose your web hosting service, (2) pick a domain name, (3) create an html file, and (4) upload the file.</p>
							<p>1) Web Hosting Service: <a href="https://hostingfacts.com/">hostingfacts.com</a> recently published its list of the "10 Best Web Hosting Services in 2018." They listed Bluehost as #1 for best reliability. After doing a bit more research I decided to go with Bluehost. </p>
							<p>2) Domain Name: My next step was picking a domain name (edezekiel.com).</p>
							<p>3) Create an HTML File: I used Sublime to create this html file. I named the file "index.html."</p>
							<p>4) Upload the HTML File: This step was my biggest hurdle, but I found a great tutorial on youtube at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUmfXTnFMuw"><span>dancourses</span></a>. Dan explains the cpanel and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) methods for uploading a HTML file. Cpanel is a linux webhost used by Bluehost and other web hosting services. You can log into cpanel by adding "/cpanel" to the end of your website name (e.g., "www.edezekiel.com/cpanel"). FTP creates a connection between a computer and a hosting account. Cpanel got the job done for now, but I will use FTP as my website grows.</p>
							<p>Thank you for reading! I have a lot of exciting posts for this blog coming soon, and I can't wait to see where this project takes me.</p>
